Welcome to the Ecobreeze (JS) pattern library.

The pattern library follows an atomic design methodology. Breaking parts of the site into it's smallest form (atoms), then combining them gradually to form molecules, organisms and finally page templates.

If you want to skip the jargon above and simply want to copy and paste parts of the site, please use the 'templates' group in 'components'.

To learn more on atomic design and why we use it in our pattern libraries, please reference - https://noface.co.uk/design-systems-pattern-libraries/

## Getting Started

This library can be installed as a submodule to your sites repository by using `git submodule add` followed by the repository link from within your sites folder.

Once added as a submodule, you may add the public CSS files as dependencies in your sites HTML `<head>` element.
